Comment[Submitted Name]	Transcriptome analysis of AML samples at diagnosis and relapse after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)				
Investigation Title	Transcriptome analysis of AML samples at diagnosis and relapse after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)
Experiment Description	Transcriptome profiling of Acute Myeloid Leukemia samples. This dataset includes patients with diagnosis of de novo or secondary AML who experienced non-HLA loss disease relapse after allo-HCT, and for whom paired pre- and post-transplant viable leukemic samples were available.

Protocol Description	Patients with diagnosis of de novo or secondary AML who experienced non-HLA loss disease relapse after allo-HCT, and for whom paired pre- and post-transplant viable leukemic samples had been collected upon specific written informed consent, in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki. Samples were collected from rom the San Raffaele Leukemia Biobank, the Universitätsklinikum Essen Biobank, the Universitätsklinikum Freiburg Biobank, the Hokkaido University Biobank, the Leiden University Medical Center Biobank, the Johns Hopkins University Biobank and the Institut Paoli-Calmettes Biobank	Total RNA were extracted using RNeasy® Plus Mini or Micro Kits (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany). following the manufacturers' indications. Nucleic acid quantification was performed using a Nanodrop-2000c spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and quality control was performed taking advantage of the Agilent Bioanalyzer technology or the RNA Screen Tape System (both from Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA).	Libraries were prepared starting from 300 ng of total RNA and using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA library preparation kit (Illumina) in accordance with low-throughput protocol. After PCR enrichment (15 cycles) and purification of adapter-ligated fragments, the concentration and length of DNA fragments were measured using D1000 Screen Tape System (Agilent)	RNA-seq libraries were sequenced using Illumina Next-Seq 500 high-output kit
